# Spam Detector Web App using Multinomial Naive Bayes 📧

This project implements a spam detector using a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier. It is deployed as a simple web application using Flask, where users can enter a text message and get a prediction on whether it is "Spam" or "Not Spam" (Ham).

The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages and uses a `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into a numerical format suitable for the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## 📄 Files Description

  * **`Spam Detector.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire process of creating the model. It includes data loading, text preprocessing, feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`, training the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, and evaluating its accuracy.
  * **`app.py`**: The backend of the web application. This Flask script loads the pre-trained model and vectorizer, handles user requests from the web page, and returns the classification result.
  * **`model.pkl`**: The saved, pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
  * **`vectorizer.pkl`**: The saved `CountVectorizer` object. This is crucial for transforming new, user-submitted text in the exact same way the original training data was transformed.
  * **`spam.csv`**: The dataset containing labeled SMS messages used to train and test the model.
  * **`templates/home.html`**: The HTML file that creates the simple user interface for the web application, including the text input form and the area to display the result.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

You can either run the final web application directly or explore the model creation process in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Part A: Running the Flask Web App

Follow these steps to run the user-facing spam detector application.

#### 1\. Get the Project Files

Download the project files to your local machine.

```bash
# Use svn to export just this folder
svn export https://github.com/SURESH6161/Data-Science/trunk/Supervised/Multinomial_Naive_Bayes%20Spam_Detector_Appa

# Navigate into the new directory
cd Multinomial_Naive_Bayes Spam_Detector_Appa
```

*(Alternatively, you can download the entire repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and navigate to this folder).*

#### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

This keeps your project dependencies clean and isolated.

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3\. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project directory with the following content:

**`requirements.txt`**:

```
Flask
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
```

Now, install all the required libraries with one command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4\. Run the Application

Start the Flask server by running the `app.py` file.

```bash
python app.py
```

#### 5\. View in Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

**[http://127.0.0.1:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000)**

You can now enter any message into the text box to see if the model classifies it as spam.

### Part B: Exploring the Jupyter Notebook

If you want to understand how the model was built, you can run the Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Ensure you have Jupyter installed**. If not, add `notebook` to your `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
2.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook** from your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is still active):
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Open the notebook**. In the browser tab that opens, click on `Spam Detector.ipynb` to view and run the code cells.
