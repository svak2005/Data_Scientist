Student Pass/Fail Prediction using Random Forest
=================================================
Check the Live Page -> https://new-data-model1.onrender.com

Overview
--------
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify students at risk of failing. By analyzing factors such as study time, previous grades, and absences, the model provides an early warning system for educators and institutions to offer timely support.

Features
--------
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares student data for machine learning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key relationships between student attributes and academic outcomes.
- Predictive Modeling: Implements a Random Forest Classifier to predict pass/fail status.
- Performance Evaluation: Assesses the model's accuracy and effectiveness using standard classification metrics.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib / Seaborn
    - Scikit-learn
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Setup and Installation
----------------------
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SURESH6161/RandomForestClassifier_Student_pass_Predicter.git
   cd RandomForestClassifier_Student_pass_Predicter

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
   - For Windows: python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate
   - For macOS/Linux: python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (Note: If requirements.txt is missing, create it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing libraries.)

Usage
-----
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the main project notebook (e.g., student_prediction.ipynb).
3. Run the cells in order to see the data analysis, model training, and results.

Dataset
-------
This project uses the [Name of Your Dataset, e.g., Student Performance Dataset].
- Source: [Provide a link to the dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository]
- Description: The dataset contains [number] student records with attributes like study time, failures, school support, and final grades. The goal is to predict the binary outcome of 'Pass' or 'Fail'.
